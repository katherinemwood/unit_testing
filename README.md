# Unit Testing

This is the source code for a [blog post on unit testing](https://katherinemwood.github.io/post/testthat/) outside of a package development context.

Two small files demonstrating unit testing in R. Put them both in the same directory, set that directory as your current working directory, load library `testthat`, and call `test_file('test_dummy.R')` to run it.
